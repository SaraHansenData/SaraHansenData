## Hi there 👋

🌟 I'm Sara Hansen (they/them), a data professional specializing in biodiversity data science. I love working with the messy, complex, exciting data that describe our world. 

🌳 Currently, I am a PhD candidate at Central Michigan University. My research areas include the distribution of invasive species, management of endangered species and their habitats, and biodiversity workforce training. 

📈 Each of these projects has helped me gain various technical skills and insights into the connections between data and the people who generate them. I work primarily in R and SQL to manage databases, build machine learning models, and communicate my results to a broad range of stakeholders.

❓ I also enjoy working on fun side projects to explore new data types and data communication methods.

💚 Visit my website [SaraHansenData.com](https://www.sarahansendata.com/) if you'd like to check out some of the projects I have been involved in (and pictures of my cats 😸). And please, get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or just chat!
