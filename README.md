## Hi there 👋

* 🌟  I'm Sara Hansen, a data professional specializing in scientific research data. I love working with the messy, complex, exciting data that describe our world. 

* :cat2:  Currently, I am a Research Data Curator at Purdue's institutional respository, Purdue University Research Repository (PURR). I curate data and metadata for long-term preservation, consult with researchers to help make their published information more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), and coordinate with campus stakeholders working toward research data management. Every day brings a new challenge!

* :deciduous_tree:  My background is in ecological research, specifically the management of invasive and endangered species in Michigan. These projects helped me gain various technical skills and insights into the connections between data and the people who generate them. I worked with R, SQL, and other programs to manage databases, build machine learning models, and communicate my results to broad audiences.

* 💚  I also enjoy working on fun side projects to explore new data types and data communication methods.

* 💁  Visit my website [https://sarahansendata.wixsite.com/sarahansendata](https://sarahansendata.wixsite.com/sarahansendata) if you'd like to check out some of the projects I have been involved in (and pictures of my cats). 

* :telephone:  And please, get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or just chat!
